Device Manager Module

This module provides the DeviceManager class, responsible for managing the lifecycle and interactions with devices.

Import Structure Explanation:
-----------------------------
Due to the interdependence between the AbstractDevice class and the DeviceManager class, we face a potential circular
import issue. Specifically, the AbstractDevice class needs knowledge about the DeviceManager, and vice versa.

To handle this challenge while still allowing type checking tools like mypy to function correctly, we've made use of
Python's TYPE_CHECKING constant available in the `typing` module. This constant is `True` only when type checking is
performed, and not during runtime. This ensures that:

1. At runtime, there's no circular import, as the import statement within the TYPE_CHECKING block is effectively
   ignored.

2. During type checking (like when running mypy), the import statement is executed, allowing mypy to recognize and
   validate types.

Therefore, the `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block is a solution to maintain clean architecture while still benefiting from type
checking capabilities.

Notes:
------
The forward declaration method ("ClassName") is used for type hints within the module to further prevent any runtime
circular dependencies.

For more details on the TYPE_CHECKING constant and its usage, refer to:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING
